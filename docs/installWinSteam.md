# Valheim DS â€“ Windows - Steam Library
##### Installation instructions for setting up Valheim dedicated server on Windows using Steam

**Disclaimer:**  *This guide assumes you've installed and launched Valheim (game) at least once.*

---
**Step 1:** Launch Steam, go to your Library, and search here for the **Valheim.**

**Step 4a:** Edit the file named `start_headless_server` as follows:
![how_to_edit](../assets/installWinSteam/edit_script.png)

**Step 4b:** This is where you edit the server properties. (Do **NOT** delete the quotes!)

`-name` = Server Listing Name. (Make it something unique like `"Awesome Nords"`)

`-port` = The port you want the server to communicate over. (You can leave it default)

 `-world` = Establishes the world file name, equivalent to a "save". (Make it unique! `"Northern Sky"`)

 `password` = **Atleast 5 characters** and **CAN'T** contain the server **_or_** world name! **_ie:_** `"@secret!pass0"`

**Step 4c:** Click **File**>**Save As**; at the prompt, enter a unique name for the script.

`my_valheim_server.bat` works nicely! You **MUST** put "**.bat**" at the end of your file name!

Click **SAVE!** Then close the file.

**Step 5:** Start your shiny new server, by double clicking the file name in Windows Explorer.
![start_your_server](../assets/installWinSteam/start_your_server.png)

**Step 5a:** This server-terminal will pop-up showing you the server has properly launched.
![initial_server_startup](../assets/installWinSteam/server_startup.png)

**Step 5b:** Windows Defender will prompt you a short time after the server-terminal has started.

Accept the defaults and click ![WD_allow_access](../assets/installWinSteam/wd_allow_access.png)
![windows_defender_prompt](../assets/installWinSteam/windows_defender.png)

**Step 5c:** Wait for this line to appear in the server-terminal; this indicates the world/server has successfully initiated.
![server_initialized_successfully](../assets/installWinSteam/server_success.png)

**Step 6:** Add the server to your Steam Server Favorites, via `127.0.0.1:2457`.  
Click "Find Games At This Address".
**NOTE :** If you don't know how to add a Favorite, checkout this [guide](https://valheim-server-help.github.io/howToConnect/#steam-servers)

# Stopping your Valheim Server

Click on your server-terminal, and press CTRL + C together. This will nicely stop the server.

You should **ALWAYS** stop the server this way. (If it asks you "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?", press **Y**)
